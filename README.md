# THE DRIVING QUIZ

The Driving Quiz is an online quiz game for those who are learning to drive a car. This game is about making aware of reponsibility on roads currently on Irish Roads. The goal of this website is to provide information about how to drive a car and can test their knowledge with a fun interactive game.
      
The layout should be easily accessible and intuitive to new users. The project should conform
to the best practices of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.
